Some of the applications were complex builds requiring custom APIs, dedicated databases and robust user interfaces with responsive design, while others were simple React applications designed to display basic touch content on a screen of defined dimensions. Projects tended to utilise React, Node and AWS, but some required specific technologies such as Electron, ML5, Socket.io or ThreeJS to match unique design criteria.`,
