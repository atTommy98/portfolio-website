        Back in 2020 I graduated from university with a bachelors degree in
        Chemistry and after completing my dissertation on the use of computer
        programming in Chemical analysis, I had the luxury of embarking on my
        programming journey with the help of{" "}

        years later and I&apos;m still loving building full stack applications

        producing/playing music or sat cross-legged digging into the science and
        mathematics of how the world around us works.
